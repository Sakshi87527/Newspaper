However, the space agency added that it would continue efforts to establish contact. After a 40-day journey into space, the Chandrayaan-3 lander, 'Vikram', touched down on August 23 at the uncharted lunar South Pole making India the first country to do so. After transversing over 100 meters on the lunar surface from the Shiv Shakti Point, the touchdown spot of the lander Vikram on the lunar surface, the rover Pragyan was safely parked and set into sleep mode on September 2.</p></td>
